# programming-logic-and-algorithms
This repository is a personal collection of JavaScript exercises I've been working on to enhance my understanding of programming logic and algorithms. It serves as a space to practice key concepts and strengthen my problem-solving skills. The exercises span various fundamental topics, from variables and conditionals to arrays, matrices, and debugging techniques.

I created this repo to document my learning journey and to have a place where I can keep challenging myself with different exercises, gradually improving my logical thinking and JavaScript skills.

## Topics Covered
- **Variables**: Understanding and using variables to store data.
- **Input and Output**: Managing user input and displaying output.
- **Assignment Command (Processing)**: Using assignment operators to perform calculations and data processing.
- **Conditional Structures**: Working with `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements to control program flow.
- **Repetitive Structures**: Mastering loops such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while` to repeat actions.
- **Arrays**: Handling and manipulating arrays to store collections of data.
- **Matrices**: Working with 2D arrays (matrices) for more complex data structures.
- **Desk Checking (Testes de Mesa)**: Practicing the technique of manually simulating program execution to find errors and understand logic.
- **Program Debugging**: Identifying and fixing bugs in JavaScript programs to ensure correct functionality.
